            Three generations of keeping people comfortable, one perfectly calibrated thermostat at a time.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              It all started in 1952 when Frosty McHeaterson Sr. got tired of his neighbors complaining about 
              their broken heaters. Armed with nothing but a toolbox and an unhealthy obsession with indoor 
              comfort, he founded what would become the region's most trusted HVAC company.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Today, we're still family-owned and operated, though we've upgraded from Frosty Sr.'s rusty pickup 
              truck to a fleet of modern service vehicles. What hasn't changed is our commitment to treating every 
              home like our own and every customer like family (the kind you actually like).
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              We've survived disco, mullets, and even the great thermostat wars of '87. Through it all, we've 
              maintained our reputation for quality work, fair pricing, and the occasional dad joke during service calls.
